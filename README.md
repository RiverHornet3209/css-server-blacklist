# CS:S-server-blacklist

Forked from https://github.com/Ballganda/css-server-blacklist, it now blocks thousands (yes, thousands) more spam servers

This is my server blacklist file to block the giant cess pool of fake servers that started to appear in CS:S in 2023  

## If you still have spam in your CS:S browser after installing this, sort them by IP address in browser and report any unique IPs as an issue here in the issues section. Please we need to work together to clear this spam.

I will update as I notice my browser filling up again with trash.

#Installation/import

Recommended method is to import this list into your game. This will add to any blacklisting you may have already done.  
Download the "server_blacklist.txt" file from here to a location you remember. Can delete the file after import 
(Optional) Backup your current "server_blacklist.txt" file if present at \steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\cfg"
Open CS:S  
Open the server browser  
Go to the "Blacklisted Servers" tab  
At the lower right, click the "Import servers from file" button  
Select the "server_blacklist.txt" file you downloaded and import it  
Done  
Can now delete the txt file you downloaded from here  

For your information:  
The "server_blacklist.txt file used/saved by CS:S lives in the CS:S cfg folder found on Windows installs at "Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\cfg" 
(Can also be found in "SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\cfg")
